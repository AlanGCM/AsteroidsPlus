Team 7 by
 Patrick Hale, Sandeep Shahi, Alan Carvajal, Rene Medina


CS Computer Graphics - 4361.001
The University of Texas at Dallas

Goals of the project
Practice and utilize the concept of computer graphics 
Create a program that can be shown as successful result of planning and development
Build on teamwork and communication skills
Improve understanding of computer graphics programming and concepts
Make a game that is enjoyable and looks appealing 

Specifications of the final product
Show off concepts learned from the course
Transformation, rotations, and translations
Logical vs device coordinate systems
Isotropic vs anisotropic mapping
Clipping
Area detection
Space-based game inspired by the original asteroids game
Rotation and thruster controls
Turning using left and right arrow keys or ‘a’ and ‘d’
Acceleration using the up and down keys or ‘w’ and ‘s’
Destructible floating rocks
Object can be broken into smaller objects
Simple AI enemies
Will try to shoot at player to add more challenge
Predictable flight path and can be destroyed
Collision detection
Collision will be a property of both the ship and obstacles
Ships will explode if they hit an object
Rocks will bounce off each other
Sound implementation
There will be background music throughout the game
Music will change depending on level
Sound effects will be implemented for specific conditions
Music and sound effects will be independent from each other
Possible upgrades or alternative mechanics to add a new spin 
Upgrades: stronger lasers, shields, bombs
Mechanics: gravity distortion, wormholes, black holes, colors
 	

Tools (System, OS, Compiler, Other software) 
Operating System - Linux / macOS / Windows
Compiler/Development IDE - Eclipse 
Language - Java, OpenGL
